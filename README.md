# Game Boy Music ROMs

A collection of Game Boy Music ROMs I made. Their code derives from my early [GBVisualizer](https://github.com/LIJI32/GBVisualizer) tech demo.

The ROMs include:

* [zord.gbc](https://github.com/LIJI32/GBMusicROMs/blob/master/zord.gbc?raw=true) – *Scales of Zordium* from *Within a Deep Forest* (Compatible with Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance)
* [lab.gbc](https://github.com/LIJI32/GBMusicROMs/blob/master/lab.gbc?raw=true) – *Underwater Lab* from *Within a Deep Forest* (Compatible with Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance)
* [PrayerX.gbc](https://github.com/LIJI32/GBMusicROMs/blob/master/PrayerX.gbc?raw=true) – *Prayer X* by *King Gnu* (Compatible with Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance)
* [Omori.gbc](https://github.com/LIJI32/GBMusicROMs/blob/master/Omori.gbc?raw=true) – The Main Theme from *Omori* (Compatible with all models)
